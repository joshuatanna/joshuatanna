                <p>
                    Khabib Abdulmanapovich Nurmagomedov (born 20 September 1988) is a Russian mixed martial arts promoter and retired professional mixed martial artist.
                    He notably competed in the lightweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he was the longest-reigning UFC Lightweight Champion, having held the title from April 2018 to March 2021. 
                    With 29 wins and no losses, he retired with an undefeated record.
                    A two-time Combat Sambo World Champion, Nurmagomedov has a background in the disciplines of sambo, judo and wrestling. His style of grappling has made him one of the most dominant athletes in mixed martial arts (MMA) history.
                    Nurmagomedov was ranked #1 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings at the time of his retirement and until being removed following his title vacation in March 2021.
                    Fight Matrix ranks him as the #1 lightweight of all time.

                    An ethnic Avar hailing from the Republic of Dagestan in Russia, Nurmagomedov is the first Muslim to win a UFC title. He is the most-followed Russian on Instagram, with more than 28 million followers as of April 2021.
                    Following his retirement, Nurmagomedov purchased the Gorilla Fighting Championship (GFC), a Russian-based MMA promotion for $1 million â€“ going on to rename it as the Eagle Fighting Championship (EFC).
